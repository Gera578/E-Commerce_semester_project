This code is for my semester project.

It's an eCommerce simulator in that can be seen from both sides: Costumer and Admin.

The customer can make purchases, spend and withdraw money, get a file with the order, and get history of orders.

The admin can see the stock, re-stock, put categories in products.

This project works with Recursion using Sorting algorithms like mergeSort, linked lists, template classes, Dynamic arrays (no vectors), inheritance, and polymorphism

Hope you can see this code as helpful:)
